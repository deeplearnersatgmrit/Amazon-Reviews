# Fitbit-Amazon-Reviews
Sentiment Analysis is a popular technique in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract subjective information from a given body of text. There are many pre-trained models available that can preform this task relatively accurately. However, when it comes to product reviews on Amazon or other E-commerce sites, it's more beneficial to extract individual topic sentiment rather than the review sentiment.

Given a list of terms one might be interested in, we can extract a general sentiment around those terms, regardless of the star-rating a user might give. 

## Data

Data was scraped from Amazon.com for Fitbit devices.

## Results of Pre-trained Models

Sentiment extracted for each topic is summarized below in a heatmap.
